# Shadowloop

Shadowloop is a first-person horror puzzle game in which the player must solve environmental challenges to break out of a recurring time loop.

## ðŸŽ“ Project Overview
This was the **main project of our course**, developed within **three months**, strictly following the planned schedule and an **internal deadline**. The development process simulated a professional studio workflow, ensuring a clear division between designers and programmers, effective collaboration, and structured iteration.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Time-loop mechanic:** The player is repositioned in real time to simulate a recursive environment.
- **Physics-based object interaction:** Advanced object rotation mechanics.
- **Enemy AI:** A dynamic enemy that reacts to the player's actions.

## ðŸŽ® My Role: Game Programmer
During development, I contributed by:
- **Designing and implementing the core loop mechanic**, allowing real-time player repositioning to simulate a recursive environment.
- **Creating the main menu system**, ensuring responsive communication between UI elements and in-scene actors.
- **Developing the in-game UI**, including pause menu, game over screen, and credits panel, maintaining a seamless flow between transitions and menus.
- **Building a basic save system** to store key player progress and game state data across sessions.
